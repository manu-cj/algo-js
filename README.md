# Algorithmics with JavaScript

## Training goals

Algorithmics is the very base of the developer job. We will learn it with the JavaScript language.

At the end of this training the trainee will have been introduced to the following aspect of JavaScript:

* Variables
* Operators
* Arrays
* Control Structures
* Functions
* Objects

The trainee will then be able to begin its learning of JavaScript in the context of Web Development.

### Requirements
- IDE installed on your computer (for example [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Guidelines for all exercises

Before beginning the exercises create a public Github repository in your Github account named **algo-js**.

You can follow this pattern.

``` console
|- algo-js
|- 01.intro
    |- 1.1
        |- index.html
        |- app.js
    |- 1.2
        |- index.html
        |- app.js
...
```
